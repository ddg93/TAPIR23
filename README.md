# Travaux d'APprentissage et d'Initiation à la Recherche 2022/23: Flexible fibres in a shear flow

## Sujet N°3 bis: flexible fibers in a shear flow

### The objective of this project is to experimentally study the behavior of a flexible fibre in a shear flow. More simply, it will consist in making a fibre from a product used by dentists to make dental impressions. Then, we will then measure the Young's modulus of this fibre, characterize the shear flow by PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) and finally observe the behavior of the particle when it is immersed in this flow using tracking methods.


### Context:
#### Figure 1

Fibre-laden flows are encountered in the fabrication of several materials, including High Performance Fibre-reinforced Concrete (Fig. 1.(a), copyright: www.marseille-tourisme.com) and paper (Fig. 1.(b), copyright: Jan Homann, Wikipedia). Also, fibres are effective addictives which enhance the performance of simple and complex fluids where they are dispersed, such as water jets (Fig. 1.(c), (source: Karpikov, 2005)) and mascara (Fig1.(d), copyright: 3D Silk Fiber Mascara, Milky Spoon).

The theory of Jeffery (Jeffery, PRSA, 1922) still represents the most accurate description of the rotational dynamics of an ellipsoid or, through the equivalence of shape of Cox (Cox, JFM, 1971), a fibre suspended in a viscous shear flow. According to Jeffery and as confirmed experimentally in the following years (Taylor, PRSA, 1923; Trevelyan and S. G. Mason, JCS, 1951, Harris and Pittman, JCIS, 1974), an axisymmetrical particle under shear will determine a periodic dynamical system, where its extremities describe one out of infinite and equiprobable, closed orbits, i.e. the Jeffery orbits.


### Roadmap:
#### Monday
- [ ] Prepare the fibres for the experiments
- [ ] Characterize the fibres: measurements of their shape, aspect ratio, density and Young's modulus.
#### Tuesday
- [ ] Prepare the fluids for the experiments: low and high viscosity;
- [ ] Characterize the fluids for the experiments: density and viscosity measurements;
- [ ] Characterize the viscous shear flow: PIV measurements;
#### Wednesday
- [ ] Perform the experiments;
- [ ] Post-process the experiments: measurements of the orientation and deformation of the fibres;
#### Thursday
- [ ] Anaylise the results and draw the conclusions.
