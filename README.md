# Travaux d'APprentissage et d'Initiation à la Recherche 2022/23: Flexible fibres in a shear flow

## Sujet N°3 bis: flexible fibers in a shear flow

### The objective of this project is to experimentally study the behavior of a flexible fibre in a shear flow. More simply, it will consist in making a fibre from a product used by dentists to make dental impressions. Then, we will then measure the Young's modulus of this fibre, characterize the shear flow by PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) and finally observe the behavior of the particle when it is immersed in this flow using tracking methods.


### Context:


### Roadmap:
#### Monday
-[ ] Prepare the fibres for the experiments
-[ ] Characterize the fibres: measurements of their shape, aspect ratio, density and Young's modulus.
#### Tuesday
-[ ] Prepare the fluids for the experiments: low and high viscosity;
-[ ] Characterize the fluids for the experiments: density and viscosity measurements;
-[ ] Characterize the viscous shear flow: PIV measurements;
#### Wednesday
-[ ] Perform the experiments;
-[ ] Post-process the experiments: measurements of the orientation and deformation of the fibres;
#### Thursday
-[ ] Anaylise the results and draw the conclusions.
